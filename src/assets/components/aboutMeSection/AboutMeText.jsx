        <p className="text-white ">Iâ€™m a passionate developer with a strong focus on React, Tailwind CSS, and Machine Learning. I enjoy building interactive web applications, including projects like e-commerce platforms, mental health chatbots, and AI-powered tools. My expertise spans data science, AI models, and big data frameworks like Apache Spark and Hadoop.
            I thrive on solving complex problems, whether it's developing scheduling AI models, working with deep learning architectures like RNNs and LSTMs, or enhancing images using GANs and curently learning Gen-AI. With a knack for both front-end design and back-end logic, I love creating seamless, responsive user experiences.
            Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in Tailwind CSS, integrating it with React to craft beautiful, responsive UIs. ðŸš€</p>
